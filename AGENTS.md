## Brain Protocol

`.brain/` is the project memory and source of truth for architecture, product state, tasks, and implementation context. Treat Brain documentation as part of the definition of done for every meaningful change.

Before starting work:

- Read the relevant Brain files for the task. Start with `.brain/BRAIN.md`, `.brain/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, `.brain/system/overview.md`, `.brain/system/architecture.md`, `.brain/engineering/ai-rules.md`, `.brain/engineering/coding-standards.md`, and `.brain/tasks/in-progress.md`.
- For feature work, also read the matching file in `.brain/features/` and any related ADR in `.brain/decisions/`.
- For API, auth, permission, database, or migration work, read the matching files under `.brain/api/` and `.brain/database/`.
- If the repository root defines both `db:migrate` and `db:push` scripts and Prisma schema/database files are changed, run both commands after the Prisma update. Do not manually create migration files.

After code changes:

- Run a Brain documentation impact check before finishing.
- Update `.brain/database/schema.md`, `.brain/database/relationships.md`, or `.brain/database/migrations.md` for database changes.
- For Prisma database updates, if root scripts `db:migrate` and `db:push` exist, run `bun db:migrate` and `bun db:push` after changing the schema. Do not manually create migration files.
- Update `.brain/api/endpoints.md`, `.brain/api/contracts.md`, or `.brain/api/permissions.md` for API, contract, auth, or permission changes.
- Update or create `.brain/features/<feature>.md` for feature behavior changes.
- Add an ADR under `.brain/decisions/` for durable architecture, product, integration, or implementation decisions.
- Update `.brain/tasks/backlog.md`, `.brain/tasks/in-progress.md`, `.brain/tasks/done.md`, or `.brain/tasks/roadmap.md` when task state changes.
- If no Brain update is needed, state that explicitly in the final response with the reason.

Final responses must include the Brain files updated, or `No Brain documentation updates required` with a short rationale.
